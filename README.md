# Hand Gesture Volume Control 🎸🖐️

A fun Computer Vision project using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to control your PC's volume—with just your hand gestures!  
Built by a music-loving coder who plays guitar and enjoys making creative tools.

***

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time hand tracking** with your webcam.
- **Volume up/down** by changing the distance between your index finger and thumb.
- **Intuitive visual feedback**: see detected landmarks and lines between your fingers.
- Works on Windows, Mac (some features OS-dependent).

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
```

### Clone & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aawhan0/HandGestureTracker
cd HandGestureTracker
python volume-controller.py
```

## 🤖 How It Works

- The program captures live webcam feed.
- Detects your hand and landmarks via MediaPipe.
- Tracks index tip (id: 8) and thumb tip (id: 4).
- Draws circles on tips, line connecting them, and calculates the distance.
- If the fingers move apart—volume goes up!  
  Move them together—volume goes down!
